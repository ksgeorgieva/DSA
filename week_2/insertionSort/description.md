#Insertion Sort

**Description**

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a sorted
version of that array. Use the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort the array.

**Sample Input**

```js
array = [8, 5, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3];
```

**Sample Output**

```js
[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 8, 9];
```

**Function Declaration**

```js
const insertionSort = (array) => {};
```

**Target Complexity**

**Best:** O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array\
**Average:** O(n^2) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array\
**Worst:** O(n^2) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
